+ I don't like food without chips, that's why I always add it to my food               +
+ by using $ echo "Chips" > myFoodName                                                 +
# echo command displays a line of text.                                                #
+ But beacause I want to display it inside my food I used the redirection operator >   +
# > : It's a redirection operator which redirects our output to the file.              #        
+ > Note : > : It will override whatâ€™s in the file. To avoid that use >>               +
# >> :It's a redirection operator which appends to a file without deleting its content +
+ Try to add chips and then salad to your food.                                        +
